This folder contains all codes and data necessary to reproduce the behavioral and MRI analyses

Please note that the codes needs: 
Matlab R2014b or a more resent version, with SPM8 or above
FSL 3.3.0 or a more resent version
ANTs 2.1.0 or a more resent version
Python 2.7 &! 3.5 or a more resent version
R 3.1.1 or a more resent version


Please get in touch with your experiences with using the codes and data, and any bug reports or issues to me at david.munoz@etu.unige.ch
