Folders are organised in BIDS format (see in each folder for further info)


Please note that not these scripts have been modified for reproducibility purpose (e.g. code flexibility) and are then not exactly the same used by us. The scripts should work as it is but some of them might need to be adapted.

Codes and data from the REWOD project
David Munoz david.munoz@etu.unige.ch

This folder contains all codes and data necessary to reproduce the behavioral and MRI analyses

Please note that the codes needs: 
Matlab R2014b or a more resent version, with SPM8 or above
FSL 3.3.0 or a more resent version
ANTs 2.1.0 or a more resent version
Python 2.7 &! 3.5 or a more resent version
R 3.1.1 or a more resent version


Please get in touch with your experiences with using the codes and data, and any bug reports or issues to me at david.munoz@etu.unige.ch
